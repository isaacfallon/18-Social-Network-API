# 18-Social-Network-API

## Description
            
This project is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM (object data modeling).

I built this application as a simple way for users to interact by sharing thoughts, adding reactions to thoughts and adding or removing friends in a simulated 'social media' environment. 

By completing this project, I've expanded my capabilities in using the MongoDB document-oriented database framework and better understand the use cases for a 'NoSQL' product.

### Video walkthrough showing application functionality:

To view a video walkthrough of how to seed some user data, run the server and access the data via its API routes using Insomnia, watch [a video demonstration here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OnQCVO41VEYPSUiV6ilflCNClgGyriBd/view?usp=sharing).

### Screenshots of using the application's API routes to manage data:

The screenshots below show the application's API routes being called in Insomnia to return specific data.  

- GET route to display all users:

- POST route to add a friend for a user:

## Installation

To install this application, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. [Refer to this guide from GitHub if you need help.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository/)

Once cloned, you will need to navigate to the project's folder in your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`.

Next, you will need MongoDB installed on your computer to initialise the database. [Visit MongoDB's website for links to download and installation instructions.](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Lastly, you'll also need to install the API client Insomnia, which you can do by [visiting their website here](https://insomnia.rest/). 

            
## Usage

Once all of the steps in [Installation](#installation) have been completed, you can optionally seed the database by entering: `node utils/seed.js`. Then to start the server, enter: `node index.js`

If everything was installed and run correctly, you should be able to test the API routes using Insomnia now. Check the [walkthrough video here to see how you can view, add, update or delete data using these routes.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OnQCVO41VEYPSUiV6ilflCNClgGyriBd/view?usp=sharing)

## Contributing

To correctly format the date for thoughts and reactions, I referenced the following Stack Overflow answers.

- [How to format a Date in MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss format in JavaScript?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10632346/how-to-format-a-date-in-mm-dd-yyyy-hhmmss-format-in-javascript) The answer referenced in this project was provided by user [Kooilnc](https://stackoverflow.com/users/58186/kooiinc).

- [How do you display JavaScript datetime in 12 hour AM/PM format?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8888491/how-do-you-display-javascript-datetime-in-12-hour-am-pm-format) The answer referenced in this project was provided by user [Abhay Kumar](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3837522/abhay-kumar).

Combining these two answers results in the date formatting found in this project's 'Reaction' and 'Thought' models as a getter function:
